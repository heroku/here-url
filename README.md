URInception
===========
[Data URLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) over HTTP.

What
----
[Data URLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) are great for encoding 
small amounts of data directly in a URL without requiring a server; 
however, they are mostly only supported in web browsers. URInception allows
Data URLs to be used with any HTTP client, such as `curl`.

Why
---
This is primarily used for integration testing file downloads with contents that can be dynamically
generated by the tests themselves. Instead of creating static test fixtures, uploading them somewhere, 
and hardcoding the URL in tests, this service allows the tests to generate Data URLs on the fly
without having the upload the file anywhere. If clients like `curl` supported Data URLs directly, 
this service would not be needed, but this acts an adaptor for such clients.

How
---
1. Create a Data URL in the standard [RFC 2397](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397.txt) format.
2. Create a new URL by setting the Data URL as the value of the `url` query parameter on any path this service. Be sure to URL encode the Data URL, as descibed in [RFC 2396](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt)
3. GET the URL

[`http://urinception.herokuapp.com/?url=data%3Aimage%2Fgif%3Bbase64%2CR0lGOD...AA7`](http://urinception.herokuapp.com/?url=data%3Aimage%2Fgif%3Bbase64%2CR0lGODdhMAAwAPAAAAAAAP%2F%2F%2FywAAAAAMAAwAAAC8IyPqcvt3wCcDkiLc7C0qwyGHhSWpjQu5yqmCYsapyuvUUlvONmOZtfzgFzByTB10QgxOR0TqBQejhRNzOfkVJ%2B5YiUqrXF5Y5lKh%2FDeuNcP5yLWGsEbtLiOSpa%2FTPg7JpJHxyendzWTBfX0cxOnKPjgBzi4diinWGdkF8kjdfnycQZXZeYGejmJlZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4XUtwvKOzrcd3iq9uisF81M1OIcR7lEewwcLp7tuNNkM3uNna3F2JQFo97Vriy%2FXl4%2Ff1cf5VWzXyym7PHhhx4dbgYKAAA7)


Syntax
------
```
httpurl    := "http://urinception.herokuapp.com" *urlchar "?url=" dataurl
dataurl    := "data:" [ mediatype ] [ ";base64" ] "," data
mediatype  := [ type "/" subtype ] *( ";" parameter )
data       := *urlchar
parameter  := attribute "=" value
