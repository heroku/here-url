[Data URLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) over HTTP.

What
----
[Data URLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) are great for encoding 
small amounts of data directly in a URL without requiring a server; 
however, they are mostly only supported in web browsers. This service allows
Data URLs to be used with any HTTP client, such as `curl`. Think of it as a
[here doc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document) in a URL.

Why
---
This is primarily used for integration testing file downloads with contents that can be dynamically
generated by the tests themselves. Instead of creating static test fixtures, hosting them somewhere, 
and hardcoding the URL in tests, this service allows the tests to generate a Data URL on the fly
without having the host the file anywhere. If clients like `curl` supported Data URLs directly, 
this service would not be needed, but this acts an adaptor for such clients.

How
---
1. Create a Data URL in the standard [RFC 2397](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397.txt) format 
2. URL encode the Data URL
3. Set the `url` query parameter on any path this service to the value of the encoded string.
